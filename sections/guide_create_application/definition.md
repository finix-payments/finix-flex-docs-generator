## Creating an Application

This guide walks step by step how to create an `Application` via the API. To do
so you must make 3 API requests.

1. Create a new `User` with ROLE_PARTNER that will be the owner of the `Application`

2. Create the `Application` resource

3. Enable a processor for the `Application` where merchants will be onboarded and
transactions will be processed.

<aside class="notice">
Only a User with ROLE_PLATFORM level credentials can perform these requests.
