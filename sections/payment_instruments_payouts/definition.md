# Payment Instruments

A `Payment Instrument` resource represents a payment card that may be tokenized multiple times and each tokenization produces a unique ID. Each ID may only be associated one time and to only one `Identity`. Once associated, a `Payment Instrument` may not be disassociated from an `Identity`.
