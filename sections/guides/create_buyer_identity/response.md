Now that we have successfully provisioned a `Merchant` we'll need to create an
`Identity` that represents your buyer. Don't worry tho you won't need to capture
the same amount of underwriting information from your buyer. **So long as you
don't pass a business_type field all the fields are optional.**

<aside class="warning">
Passing a business_type will introduce the underwriting form validators.

Typically, we suggest at least collecting the buyer's name and email to help
with accounting, reconciliation, and chargebacks.
