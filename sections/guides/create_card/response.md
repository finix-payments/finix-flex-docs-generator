Now that we have an Identity resource representing our buyer, we'll need to create a Payment Instrument which can represent either a card or bank account. In this instance we'll create a card with the request to the right (note you'll need to interpolate your own buyer's Identity from the previous request).

<aside class="warning">
Creating cards directly via the API should only be done for testing purposes.

Please review our guide on how to tokenize cards via the [tokenization.js library](#tokenization-js)

Be sure to store the ID of your newly tokenized Payment Instrument.
