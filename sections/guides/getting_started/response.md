This guide will demonstrate the main workflows for utilizing the {{api_name}} Payments API for platforms and marketplaces. We have language bindings in cURL, PHP, Ruby, Python, C#, Java and Perl! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

To communicate with the {{api_name}} API you'll need to authenticate your requests with a username and password. For the sandbox environment you may use the credentials listed below or you can supply your own.

- Username: `{{basic_auth_username}}`

- Password: `{{basic_auth_password}}`

You should also know your Application ID. An Application, also referred as an "App", is a resource that represents your web App or any service that connects customers (i.e. buyers) and merchants (i.e. sellers). For the sandbox environment you may use the following ID:

- App ID: `{{create_app_scenario_id}}`
