Before we can begin charging cards we'll need to provision a `Merchant` account for your seller. This requires 3-steps, which we'll go into greater detail in the next few sections:

1. First, create an `Identity` resource with the merchant's underwriting and identity verification information

    `POST https://{{base_url}}/identities/`

2. Second, create a `Payment Instrument` representing the merchant's bank account where processed funds will be settled (i.e. deposited)

    `POST https://{{base_url}}/payment_instruments/`

3. Finally, provision the `Merchant` account

    `POST https://{{base_url}}/identities/IDENTITY_ID/merchants`


Let's start with the first step by creating an `Identity` resource, which in
many ways is the centerpiece for the payment API's architecture. Each `Identity`
represents either a buyer or a merchant. We use this resource to associate cards,
bank accounts, and transactions. This structure makes it simple to manage and
reconcile a merchant's associated bank accounts, transaction history, and payouts.
More importantly, the `Identity` resource is used to collect underwriting information
for the business and its principal.

Let's create one now (look to the right for an example request). You'll want to
store the ID of the newly created `Identity` resource as you'll reference it later.
