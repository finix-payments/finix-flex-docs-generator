Awesome! Now you know how to charge a card. Next you need to settle out the
funds to your merchant's bank account (i.e. issue an ACH Credit). To do so you
will create a `Settlement` resource. A `Settlement` is a logical construct
representing a collection (i.e. batch) of `Transfers` that are intended to be
paid out to a specific `Merchant`.


Each settlement is comprised of all the `Transfers` that have a SUCCEEDED `state` and
that have not yet been previously settled out. In other words, if a merchant has a
`Transfer` in the PENDING state it will not be included in the batch settlement.
In addition, `Settlements` will include any refunded Transfers as a deduction.
The `total_amount` is the net settled amount in cents (i.e. the amount in cents
that will be deposited into your merchant's bank account after your fees have
been deducted).

<aside class="notice">
Once a batch Settlement has been created it will undergo review and typically
paid out within 24 hours.

Note, that for reconciliation purposes each `Settlement` contains a [transfers
link](#list-transfers-in-a-settlement) which returns a list of all the
`Transfers` that comprise the batch.
