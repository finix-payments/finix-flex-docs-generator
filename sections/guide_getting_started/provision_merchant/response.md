Now that we've associated a `Payment Instrument` with our seller's `Identity`
we're ready to provision a `Merchant` account. This is the last step before you
can begin processing on their behalf. Luckily you've already done most of the
heavy lifting. Just make one final POST request, and you'll be returned a
`Merchant` resource. Take a second to inspect this newly created resource,
particularly the `onboarding_state`, which can have 3 potential states that
indicate its ability to process and settle funds:

1. `PROVISIONING`: Request is pending (state will typically change after two minutes)
  * processing_enabled: False
  * settlement_enabled: False

2. `APPROVED`: Merchant has been approved and can begin processing
  * processing_enabled: True
  * settlement_enabled: True

3. `REJECTED`: Merchant was rejected by the processor either because the collected
information was invalid or it failed one of a number of regulatory and/or
compliance checks (e.g. KYC, OFAC or MATCH)
  * processing_enabled: False
  * settlement_enabled: False

<aside class="notice">
Provisioning a Merchant account is an asynchronous request. We recommend creating
a Webhook to listen for the state change.
