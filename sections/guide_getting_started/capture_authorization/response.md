Now that we have the funds held on a card, we'll need to capture them. Failing to
do so will result in the funds being released (i.e. returned) to the buyer.

Note you can capture any amount less than or equal to the `amount` of the original
 `Authorization`. You will also want to pass a `fee`. The `fee` field is the amount
 in cents you would like to keep before settling out to the merchant. For example,
 if you're charging the buyer $100 on behalf of your merchant, and you're taking
 a 10% service fee you'll want to pass 1000 as the fee. This way when the
 funds are eventually settled out only $90 will be disbursed to your merchant.

Once successfully captured the `transfer` field of the `Authorization` will
contain the ID for the corresponding `Transfer` resource. By default, `Transfers`
will be in a PENDING state. PENDING means that the system hasn't submitted the
capture request as they are submitted via batch request. Once submited
the state of the `Transfer` will update to SUCCEEDED.

Next we're going to show you how to settle out the funds to your merchant.
