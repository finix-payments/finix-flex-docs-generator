Now that we've created an `Identity` for our merchant, we'll need to add a bank
account where funds will be disbursed (i.e. their funding
account).

In the API, bank accounts -- as well as credit cards -- are represented by the
`Payment Instrument` resource.

To classify the `Payment Instrument` as a bank account you'll need to pass
BANK_ACCOUNT in the `type` field of your request, and you'll also want to pass
the ID of the `Identity` that you created in the last step via the `identity`
field to properly associate it with your merchant.
