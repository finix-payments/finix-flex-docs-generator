> Example Response:

```json
{{create_card_scenario_response}}
```

Now that we have an `Identity` resource representing our buyer, we'll need to
create a `Payment Instrument` which represents the credit card you'll be debiting
(i.e. charging).

<aside class="warning">
Please note that creating cards directly via the API should only be done for
testing purposes. You must use the Tokenization iframe or javascript client
to remain out of PCI scope.
</aside>

You'll also need to interpolate your own buyer's `Identity` ID
from the previous request to properly associate it.

Please review our guide on how to tokenize cards via the [embedded tokenization
form](#embedded-tokenization-using-iframe)
