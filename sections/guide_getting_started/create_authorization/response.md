At this point we've created resources representing the merchant, the buyer, and
the buyer's card.

Next you'll need to create an `Authorization`. What's a `Authorization`? Glad
you asked! An `Authorization` (also known as a card hold) reserves a specific
amount on a card to be captured (i.e. debited) at a later point, usually within
7 days. When an `Authorization` is captured it produces a `Transfer` resource.

To create an `Authorization` we'll supply the buyer's `Payment Instrument` ID
as the source field and the seller's `Identity` ID in the merchant_identity field.
Note that the `amount` field is in cents.

Simple enough, right? You'll also want to store the ID from that `Authorization`
for your records and so that we can capture those funds in the next step.


`Authorizations` have two possible states SUCCEEDED and FAILED. If the `Authorization`
 has succeeded, it must be captured before the `expires_at` or the funds will
 be released.

<aside class="warning">
Authorizations on debit cards actually place a hold on funds in the cardholder's
bank account and may lead to lower than expected balances and/or insufficient
funds issues.
</aside>


<aside class="notice">
If the transfer field of an Authorization is null it has not yet been captured.
