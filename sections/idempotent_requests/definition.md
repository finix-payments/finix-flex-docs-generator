## Idempotency Requests

You'll notice the authorization and transfer object have a field named `idempotency_id` which ensures the API request is only performed once. Why is this important? We've all experienced a hanging request while on a checkout page and feared that if we refresh or submit the payment again we'll be charged twice. With {{api_name}}, we remove the ambiguity by having the user generate a unique `idempotency_id` and sending it with the normal payload. If the user attempts a request with the same `idempotency_id`, the response will raise an exception. Now you can rest assured that when you create an authorization or debit a bank account that the user will be protected from potential network issues by simply passing `idempotency_id` in body of the request.
