`Authorizations` have two possible states SUCCEEDED and FAILED. If the `Authorization`
 has succeeded, it must be captured before the `expires_at` or the funds will
 be released.

<aside class="warning">
Authorizations on debit cards actually place a hold on funds in the cardholder's
bank account and may lead to lower than expected balances and/or insufficient
funds issues.
</aside>


<aside class="notice">
If the transfer field of an Authorization is null it has not yet been captured.
