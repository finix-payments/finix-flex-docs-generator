authenticate and interface with the API.

2. [Getting Started](#getting-started): A step-by-step guide demonstrating the basic workflow of charging a card. This guide will walk you through provisioning merchant accounts, tokenizing cards, charging those cards, and finally settling (i.e. payout) those funds out to your merchants.
