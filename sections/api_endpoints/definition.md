## API Endpoints

We provide two distinct base urls for making API requests depending on
whether you would like to utilize the sandbox or production environments. These
two environments are completely separate and share no information, including
API credentials. For testing please use the Staging API and when you are ready to
 process live transactions use the Production endpoint.

- **Staging API:** `{{staging_base_url}}`

- **Production API:** `{{production_base_url}}`
