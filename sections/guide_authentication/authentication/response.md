To communicate with the {{api_name}} API you'll need to authenticate your requests
via http basic access authentication with a `username` and `password`, which you
can locate in your dashboard. If you do not have a dashboard feel free to test
the API with the credentials below:

- Username: `{{basic_auth_username}}`

- Password: `{{basic_auth_password}}`

- Application ID: `{{create_app_scenario_id}}`

Your `Application` is a resource that represents your web app. In other words,
any web service that connects buyers (i.e. customers) and sellers
(i.e. merchants).
