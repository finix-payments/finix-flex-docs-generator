# Webhooks
Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations which subscribe to certain events on the {{api_name}} API. When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. Webhooks are particularly useful for updating asynchronous state changes in Transfers or notifications of newly created Disputes.
