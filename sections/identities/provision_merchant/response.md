{{provision_merchant_scenario_response}}
```

Provision a `Merchant` for a previously created `Identity` resource to begin
transacting on their behalf.

<aside class="warning">
Please make sure that a bank account has been created and associated to the
previously created Identity before attempting to provision a Merchant account.
</aside>


`Merchant` resources can have 3 potential states:

1. `PROVISIONING`: Request is pending (state will typically change after two minutes)

2. `APPROVED`: Merchant has been approved and can begin processing

3. `REJECTED`: Merchant was rejected by the processor either because the underwriting information collected was invalid or it failed one a number of regulatory and compliance checks (e.g. KYC, OFAC or MATCH)

<aside class="notice">
Provisioning a `Merchant` account is an asynchronous request. We recommend creating a Webhook to listen for the state change.
