# Identities
An `Identity` resource represents either a buyer or a merchant and is in many
ways the centerpiece of the payment API's architecture. `Transfers` and
`Payment Instruments` must be associated with an `Identity`. For both buyers
and merchants this structure makes it easy to manage and reconcile their
associated bank accounts, transaction history, and payouts.

For merchants, the `Identity` resource is used to collect underwriting
information for the business and its principal.
