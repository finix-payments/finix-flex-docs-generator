## Check for Card Updates (Account Updater)

{{api_name}} works with card networks so that your customers can continue, without interruption, using your service even if their card has changed due to it being closed, lost, or stolen. When a successful account update record is located, the `Payment Instrument` will be automatically updated with the new primary account number or new expiration date.
