### Step 4: Associate to an Identity

> Example Response:

```json
{{associate_token_scenario_response}}
```

Before you can use the newly tokenized card you will need to associate it with
an `Identity`. To do this you must make an authenticated `POST` request to the
`/payment_instruments` endpoint with the relevant token and the buyer's
`Identity` information.

<aside class="warning">
Tokens should be associated right away. Tokens not associated within 30 mins
of creation will be invalidated.
