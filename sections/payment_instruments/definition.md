# Payment Instruments

A `Payment Instrument` resource represents either a credit card or bank account.
A `Payment Instrument` may be tokenized multiple times and each tokenization produces
a unique ID. Each ID may only be associated one time and to only one `Identity`.
Once associated, a `Payment Instrument` may not be disassociated from an
`Identity`.
