# Payment Instruments
A Payment Instrument resource represents either a credit card or bank account. All information is securely vaulted and referenced by an ID. A Payment Instrument may be created multiple times, and each tokenization produces a unique ID. Each ID may only be associated one time and to only one Identity. Once associated, a Payment Instrument may not be disassociated from an Identity.
