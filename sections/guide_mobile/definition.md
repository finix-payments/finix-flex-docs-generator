# Mobile Integration

Our mobile SDK's make it simple to accept payments inside any iOS or Android app. With these two libraries, we take on the responsibility of PCI compliance by removing the need to send sensitive payment card data to your servers. Simply use the tools to tokenize payment cards and we'll store the payment card number in our secure vault.  Next, we'll return a token that you can use to associate to an `Application`. Once associated with an `Application` you can use it to process payments.
