## Configure AVS & CVV

Banks will on occasion approve transactions although the address information or Card Verification Value (CVV) provided with the transaction doesnâ€™t match what the bank has on record. Finix offers you the ability to configure Address Verification System (AVS) and CVV rules as part of our fraud risk system, to help you ensure that transactions are being made by only authorized users.
