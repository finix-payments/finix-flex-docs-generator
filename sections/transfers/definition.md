# Transfers
A Transfer resource represents any omnidirectional flow of funds. Transfers can represent either a debit to a card, a credit to a bank account, or a refund to a card depending on the request. Transfers have a state attribute representing the current state of the transaction. There are three possible status values: PENDING, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED.
