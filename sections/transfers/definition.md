# Transfers
A `Transfer` represents any flow of funds either to or from a `Payment Instrument`.
For example, a `Transfer` can be either a [debit to a card](#debit-a-card), a
credit to a bank account, or a [refund to a card](#refund-a-debit) depending on
the request.

`Transfers` can have three possible states values: PENDING, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED.

- **PENDING:** Authorization on `Payment Instrument` successfully created (i.e.
funds are being held), but awaiting system to batch submit the capture request
to complete the transaction

- **SUCCEEDED:** Funds captured and available for settlement (i.e. disbursement
via ACH Credit)

- **FAILED:** Authorization attempt failed

By default, `Transfers` will be in a PENDING state and will eventually (typically
within an hour) update to SUCCEEDED.

<aside class="notice">
All Transfers automatically have an underlying Authorization (also known as
a card hold). If a Transfer returns PENDING this indicates that the corresponding
AUTHORIZATION was successful.
