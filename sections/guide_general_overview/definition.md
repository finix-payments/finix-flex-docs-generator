# Guides

## Overview

These guides provide a collection of resources for utilizing the {{api_name}}
API and its client libraries. We offer a number of client libraries for
interfacing with the API, and you can view example code snippets for each in
the dark area to the right.

1. [Authentication](#authentication): A quick guide on how to properly
authenticate and interface with the API.

2. [Getting Started](#getting-started): A step-by-step guide demonstrating the basic workflow
of charing a card. This guide will walk you through provisioning merchant
accounts, tokenizing cards, charging those cards, and finally settling (i.e.
payout) those funds out to your merchants.

3. [Embedded Tokenization](#embedded-tokenization-using-iframe): This guide
explains how to properly tokenize cards in production via our embedded iframe.

4. [Push-to-Card](#push-to-card): This guide walks
