```

Let's start with the first step by creating an `Identity` resource. Each `Identity` represents either a person or a business. We use this resource to associate cards and payouts. This structure makes it simple to manage and reconcile payment instruments and payout history. Accounting of funds is done using the Identity so it's recommended to have an Identity per recipient of funds. Additionally, the Identity resource is optionally used to collect KYC information.
