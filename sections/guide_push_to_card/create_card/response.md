Please note that creating cards directly via the API should only be done for
testing purposes. You must use the Tokenization iframe or javascript client
to remain out of PCI scope.

Now that we've created an `Identity` for our recipient, we'll need to tokenize a credit card where funds will be disbursed.

In the API, credit cards are represented by the `Payment Instrument` resource.

To classify the `Payment Instrument` as a credit card you'll need to pass `PAYMENT_CARD` in the type field of your request, and you'll also want to pass the ID of the `Identity` that you created in the last step via the identity field to properly associate it with your recipient.
